# Viewer text recognition

It is a web application for the transcription of historical documents.
The most important purposes:

- Managing collections and documents: you can manage your collections. These collections can be understood as a folder containing documents
- Using Handwritten Text Recognition: it enables you to automatically recognize text on images and produces a transcript of the text
- Transcribing and editing: you can use the editor for manual transcription. For this, you need to run a recognition job first in order to have the layout of the document analysed and the text regions
